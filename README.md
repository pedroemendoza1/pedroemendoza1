## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**pedroemendoza1/pedroemendoza1** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currrently taking classes at Raratitan Valley Community Collage. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: trought rvcc email G00308811@stu.raritanval.edu  
- ðŸ˜„ Nickname: PJ. This nickname is due to my father becauses his name is Pedro and my name is Pedro has well, so they call me Pedro Junior or PJ. this is also because I used to wear pj's everywhere. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: My grabdmother named all of her dogs "Tiger". I dosent matter if its a black, orange, white, or anycolor or conbination, she would always call her dogs "Tiger" for some reason.
